Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrougth its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore
For that rare and radient maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
